# Game Capture HD Linux driver

This project provides a userspace driver to natively support the Elgato Game
Capture HD under Linux and Mac OS X. This is an unofficial driver and in no way
supported by Elgato.

Use at your own risk! This software is experimental and not intended for
production use.

* Elgato Game Capture HD60 (work in progress)
* Elgato Game Capture HD60 S
* Elgato Game Capture HD60 Pro


## Firmware

This software needs Elgato Game Capture HD firmware files to work. Due to
licensing issues, they're not part of this repository. You need to extract them
yourself from the official Mac OS X drivers.

> **Mac users:** Simply install the official drivers. You don't need to manually extract the firmware files, so after you download and install the Elgato driver for OS X, skip down to the Install section.

A brief instruction (for Linux only):

1. Download Elgato Game Capture HD Mac OS X driver version 2.0.3 from official
website: https://www.elgato.com/en/game-capture-hd-support

2. Install `dmg2img` and `hfsprogs`. Please refer to your specific Linux
distribution for more information.

3. Uncompress Elgato Game Capture HD Mac OS X drivers:

    ```
    dmg2img gchdm_203_970.dmg -o gchdm_203_970.dmg.img
    ```

4. Mount the uncompressed HFS+ image with root permissions:

    ```
    mkdir /tmp/dmg
    mount -o loop -t hfsplus gchdm_203_970.dmg.img /tmp/dmg
    ```

5. Copy `mb86h57_h58_idle.bin` and `mb86h57_h58_enc_h.bin` from
`/tmp/dmg/Game\ Capture\ HD.app/Contents/Resources/Firmware/Beddo/`.

6. Place the firmware files either in `/usr/lib/firmware/gchd` or
`/usr/local/lib/firmware/gchd` folder. You might need root permissions.  
**Note**: for testing purposes, you can also place the firmware files in the
same directory, where the compiled executable `gchd` is located.


## Install

1. Install the following dependencies. Please refer to your specific Linux
distribution, as package names might differ.

  * libusb >= 1.0.20
  * cmake (make)
  * make (make)
  * qt5 (optional) - for GUI support (not usable, work in progress)
  
  `sudo apt-get install libusb cmake make`
  
  > **Mac users:** Also install pkg-config:
  > 
  > `brew install pkg-config libusb cmake make`

2. Compile the driver:

    1. Either clone or download the Git repository and extract it.

    2. Open up a terminal inside the project's root directory.
    
    > **Mac users:** Copy the libusb folder to the src folder:
    >
    > `cp /usr/local/include/libusb-1.0 ../src/`

    3. Create a new directory `build` in the project's root directory and
    navigate into it:

        ```
        mkdir build
        cd build
        ```
    
    4. Run CMake from inside the `build` directory to setup the make
    environment and compile the driver:

        ```
        cmake ..
        make
        ```
    
    > **Mac users:** If you run the make command without any parameters, as shown above, you may get an error that `libusb.h` is not found. To work around this simply specify the library path when calling `make`:
    >
    > `make LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib`

    5. The compiled executable `gchd` is located in `build/src`. If you have
    Qt5 installed on your system, the GUI `qgchd` will be located at
    `build/src/gui`.  
    **Note**: you can copy the firmware files into these directories and test
    the application, without making any system-wide modifications.

3. If the application works for you, you can optionally install it system-wide,
running `make install` from within the `build` directory. This will install the
executables to `/usr/bin`.

> **Mac users:** If you are wanting to use your Elgato with OBS Studio, there are a couple of additional steps you'll need to follow before you start the application. This is because OBS Studio doesn't let you manually enter a filename for the Media Source, and the `/tmp` directory is hidden by default. So we'll need to create a directory to which we can browse in OBS and a placeholder file that we can use to set up OBS initially.

> 1. Create a file where your stream will be created:
>
>       `sudo mkdir /stream`
>       `echo "ok" | sudo tee /stream/gchd.ts`
>
> 2. Open OBS, create a new Media Source, and set it to the file at `/stream/gchd.ts`.
>
> 3. In the `build/src` directory, start the application and specify the output file location:
>
>       `sudo ./gchd -o /stream/gchd.ts`


## Usage

### Commandline

```
Usage: gchd [options]

Options:
  -c <color-space>   Color Space settings [default: yuv]
  -f <format>        Format for <output> [default: fifo]
  -h                 Print this screen
  -i <input-source>  Input Source [default: hdmi]
  -n <ip-address>    IP address for UDP streaming [default: 0.0.0.0]
  -o <output>        Output Path [default: /tmp/gchd.ts]
  -p <port>          Port for UDP streaming [default: 57384]
  -r <resolution>    Resolution of Input Source [default: 1080]
  -v                 Print program version
  -P <pid-path>      PID path [default: /var/run/gchd.pid]
```

Options for `<color-space>` are `yuv` and `rgb`. Consoles and PCs output in
either format and usually don't support switching Color Spaces. If this option
is set incorrectly, your capture will either have a green or purple tint.
Default is set to `yuv`.

Options for `<format>` are `disk`, `fifo` and `socket`. Use `disk`, if you want
to directly record to your harddrive. Else, FIFO will cover almost all use cases
(default). Please note, that FIFOs won't grow in size, making them optimal for
streaming and more controlled capturing on systems with limited amount of memory
or SSDs. When set to `socket`, this driver will stream the output via UDP to
`<ip-address>`:`<port>` (default `0.0.0.0:57384`).

Options for `<input-source>` are `composite`, `component` and `hdmi`. Choose,
whichever source you're using. Some Resolutions are not available on all Input
Sources.

You can specify `<ip-address>` using `-n` option. The driver will stream to this
IP address, instead of default `0.0.0.0`. Please note, UDP streaming is highly
experimental at this point. Unicast works well, but Multicasting has performance
issues, causing artefacts. Multicast IPs are in the range of `224.0.0.0` -
`239.255.255.255` (RFC 5771).

`<output>` sets the location either for the FIFO or the capture file,
depending on whether `-d` has been set or not.

You can change the default `<port>` using `-p` option. Default is set in private
port range (RFC 6335) to `57384` (EGCHD).

Options for `<resolution>` are `ntsc`, `pal`, `720` and `1080`. Use whichever
resolution your input source has.

`<pid-path>` is unused at the moment. Once implemented, it will provide a
single-instance mechanism, which will prevent this driver from opening multiple
times. You can use this option in the future, if you're running this driver as a
non-root user and don't have write access to the default `<pid-path>` location.


### General

This driver must be run as root, as it needs to access your Game Capture HD
device. Under Linux, you can alternatively configure udev to make your device
accessible by non-root users.

If no commandline options are set, the device will be configured for a 1080p
HDMI source in YUV colorspace. By default, a FIFO will be created at
`/tmp/gchd.ts`. You can open it up using any media player, which supports
reading from pipes (e.g. VLC or obs-studio). There will be a slight delay, which
is a hardware limitation and can't be worked around.

If you're done using this driver, close the file, stop the terminal using
"Ctrl + C" and wait for the program to successfully terminate. The driver is
resetting your device; it may take a while. If you interrupt this step, it will
leave your device in an undefined state and you will need to manually reset your
device by reconnecting it.

Currently supported input sources:

* HDMI: 1080p60, 720p60
* Component: 480p60 (NTSC), 576p50 (PAL), 720p60, 1080i60, 1080p60
* Composite: 480i60 (NTSC), 576i50 (PAL)
